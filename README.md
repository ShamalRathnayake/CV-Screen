# CV Screen

CV Screen is a production-ready, TypeScript-based REST API that leverages AI and NLP to extract, structure, and match information from candidate CVs and job descriptions (JDs). It provides endpoints for uploading documents, extracting structured data, and predicting the suitability of candidates for job roles using advanced embedding and similarity techniques.

## üöÄ Features
- **CV & JD Extraction:** Uses LLMs to extract structured data from unstructured PDF CVs and job descriptions.
- **AI-Powered Matching:** Computes similarity scores between CVs and JDs using transformer-based embeddings.
- **Authentication & User Management:** Secure user registration, login, and profile management.
- **File Uploads:** Secure, validated PDF uploads for CVs and JDs.
- **Robust API:** RESTful endpoints for all major operations, with clear error handling and validation.
- **Dockerized:** Easy deployment for both development and production.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated testing, building, and deployment with GitHub Actions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Node.js** & **Express** (REST API framework)
- **TypeScript** (type safety)
- **MongoDB** (data storage)
- **Mongoose** (ODM)
- **@xenova/transformers** (embeddings for similarity)
- **Ollama** (LLM for extraction)
- **Jest** (testing)
- **Multer** (file uploads)
- **Docker** & **docker-compose** (containerization)
- **Stripe** (payment integration)
- **Helmet, CORS, Rate Limiting** (security)
- **GitHub Actions** (CI/CD)

## üì¶ Project Structure
- `src/modules/` ‚Äî Feature modules (CV, JD, prediction, upload, user)
- `src/shared/` ‚Äî Shared configs, middlewares, services, utils
- `src/uploads/` ‚Äî Uploaded PDF files
- `.github/workflows/` ‚Äî CI/CD pipeline configurations

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline

This project includes a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions:

### Workflows
- **Pull Request Checks** (`pull-request.yml`): Runs on PRs to main/develop
  - Linting and code formatting
  - Unit tests with MongoDB service
  - Security audits
  - Build verification

- **Deploy** (`deploy.yml`): Runs on pushes to main/develop
  - Builds and pushes Docker images to GitHub Container Registry
  - Deploys to staging (develop branch)
  - Deploys to production (main branch)

- **Security** (`security.yml`): Runs on pushes, PRs, and weekly
  - npm audit checks
  - Snyk vulnerability scanning
  - Container vulnerability scanning with Trivy

- **Dependency Updates** (`dependency-updates.yml`): Runs weekly
  - Checks for outdated dependencies
  - Creates PRs for updates

### Setup
1. **Repository Secrets** (required):
   - `SNYK_TOKEN`: Your Snyk API token for security scanning

2. **Environment Protection** (recommended):
   - Create `staging` and `production` environments in GitHub
   - Add environment-specific secrets and protection rules

3. **Branch Protection** (recommended):
   - Require PR checks to pass before merging
   - Require up-to-date branches before merging

## üìë API Endpoints
All endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1`.

### Auth & User
- `POST   /user/create` ‚Äî Register a new user
- `POST   /user/login` ‚Äî Login and receive JWT
- `PUT    /user/update` ‚Äî Update user profile (auth required)
- `GET    /user/:id` ‚Äî Get user by ID (auth required)
- `GET    /user/payment` ‚Äî Create payment intent (Stripe)

### File Upload
- `POST   /upload/` ‚Äî Upload one or more PDF files (field: `file`)

### Prediction
- `POST   /prediction/` ‚Äî Predict suitability for a single CV & JD
- `POST   /prediction/multi` ‚Äî Predict for multiple CVs (auth required)

### Health
- `GET    /health` ‚Äî Health check

## üèóÔ∏è Setup & Running

### 1. Clone & Install
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd CV-Screen
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Create a `.env.dev` (for dev) or `.env.prod` (for prod) in the root with:
```
PORT=4000
NODE_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://<user>:<pass>@<host>:<port>/<db>
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
LOG_LEVEL=info
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_key
PRO_CHARGE=100 # or your price
```

### 3. Local Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. With Docker (Recommended)
#### Development
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml --env-file .env.dev up --build
```
#### Production
```bash
docker-compose --env-file .env.prod up --build
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:4000/api/v1`.

## üìÇ Uploads
- Only PDF files are accepted (max 5MB each).
- Uploaded files are stored in `src/uploads/`.

## üß† How It Works
- **Extraction:** LLM (via Ollama) parses PDFs to extract structured candidate/job data.
- **Embedding:** Text is embedded using `@xenova/transformers` (MiniLM-L6-v2).
- **Matching:** Cosine similarity is computed between CV and JD embeddings for overall, technical, education, and work experience fit.

## üß™ Testing
```bash
npm test
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Troubleshooting
- Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible.
- Check `.env` for all required variables.
- For LLM extraction, Ollama must be running and accessible at the configured URL.
- Only PDF files are supported for upload.
